# ⚙️ COMSOL Multiphysics Projects

Welcome to my collection of **COMSOL Multiphysics** simulation projects! This repository contains models developed for analyzing and visualizing various physical systems using the **finite element method (FEM)** in COMSOL.

These projects span domains such as:
- Heat transfer
- Electromagnetics
- Fluid dynamics
- Multiphysics coupling
